### Define the Problem & Goals

- [ ] Clearly define the research question:
    What makes players "similar"?
    Are you clustering by playstyle, impact, or something else?
    How will you evaluate if the clustering is meaningful?

- [ ] Define success metrics:
    How well do the clusters map to real NBA positions?
    Are they stable across seasons?
    Do they make intuitive sense?

### Data Collection & Preprocessing

- [x] Gather the right data:
    You already have per-100 possession stats—do you want to add other data like advanced stats, defensive/offensive ratings, or tracking data later?
    Do you want to include multiple seasons per player or just their best season?

- [x] Clean & preprocess the data:
    Handle missing values (drop, impute, or replace).
    Normalize features to avoid bias (e.g., Min-Max Scaling or Standardization).
    Remove outliers if they distort results (e.g., players with <300 minutes).
    Decide how to handle multi-season players (average stats, best season, etc.).

### Feature Engineering & Selection

- [x] Choose relevant features:
    Not all stats are equally valuable for clustering—do you include free throws? Turnovers?
    Should you combine some stats (e.g., Usage Rate * True Shooting % for scoring efficiency)?

- [x] Reduce dimensionality (if needed):
    PCA or t-SNE can help if the data is too high-dimensional and noisy.

### Clustering Algorithm Selection

- [ ] Try multiple clustering techniques:
    K-Means (good for well-separated clusters, assumes spherical clusters).
    DBSCAN (can detect outliers, good for unevenly shaped clusters).
    Hierarchical Clustering (useful for visualizing relationships).
    Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) (soft clustering, allows overlap).

- [ ] Find the best number of clusters:
    Use the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to decide.

### Cluster Evaluation & Interpretation

- [ ] Compare clusters with real NBA positions:
    Do the clusters map well to PG, SG, SF, PF, C?
    Are there hybrid player types that traditional positions don’t capture?

- [ ] Visualize the clusters:
    PCA/t-SNE for 2D visualization.
    Heatmaps to compare cluster averages.

- [ ] Check stability:
    Are clusters stable across different seasons?
    What happens if you tweak features or cluster numbers?
